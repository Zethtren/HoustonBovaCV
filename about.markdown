# My Mission:

My dream for the future is one where everyone has immediate access to all the resources they need to learn and perform the tasks they are passionate about. Any role which allows me to use programming and artifical intelligence to improve upon existing structures or help establish new structures in an effort to reach this goal I will be enthusiastic to apply my talents towards. 


I aim to use Machine Learning to;
- Increase accessibility to technology
- Help companies and individuals provide their services more efficiently
- Improve usability and reduce both financial and time costs
